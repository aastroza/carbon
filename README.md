# carbon

Our project helps people learn about their carbon footprint with a fun game powered by AI. We use LLMs to estimate the carbon impact of different things and create an engaging way to understand and care about the environment.

## Motivation

We are addressing the urgent need to increase awareness about carbon footprints. Many people do not understand the impact of their daily choices on emissions. For example, an apple generates 35g of CO2, while a portion of beef produces 7,700g[^1]. Calculating and visualizing the environmental impact is complex, and current tools are tedious and unattractive. We aim to create a fun, accessible educational experience to promote carbon literacy.

Our project uses AI in two main components:

- *Carbon Footprint Estimation Model:* It estimates the carbon footprint of any concept entered by the user using GPT-4 and semantic search.
- *Educational Game:* Players place cards on a "carbon line" based on their estimated carbon footprint. An AI agent supervises the game, ensuring fairness and evaluating the originality of each move.

Our innovative approach combines advanced AI with game mechanics to create an engaging educational experience about carbon footprints.

### What is a carbon footprint?

Mike Bernes-Lee [^2] defines the term "carbon footprint" as follows:

> “Carbon footprint” is a phrase that is horribly abused. I want to make my definition clear. Throughout this book, I’m using “footprint” as a metaphor for the total impact that something has. And I’m using the word “carbon” as shorthand for all the different global warming greenhouse gases.
> So, I’m using the term “carbon footprint” to mean the best estimate we can get of the full climate change impact of something. That something could be anything—an activity, an item, a lifestyle, a company, a country, or even the whole world.
