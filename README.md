## Motivation

### What is a carbon footprint?

Mike Bernes-Lee [^1] defines the term "carbon footprint" as follows:

> “Carbon footprint” is a phrase that is horribly abused. I want to make my definition clear. Throughout this book, I’m using “footprint” as a metaphor for the total impact that something has. And I’m using the word “carbon” as shorthand for all the different global warming greenhouse gases.
> So, I’m using the term “carbon footprint” to mean the best estimate we can get of the full climate change impact of something. That something could be anything—an activity, an item, a lifestyle, a company, a country, or even the whole world.
